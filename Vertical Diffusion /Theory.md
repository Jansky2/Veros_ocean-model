Vrtical diffusion is the process by which heat or salt is transported up and down due to molecular or turbulent mixing.

The temperate gradient dt/dz drives the heat flux:

qz = -Kv dT/dz

the divergence of flux (how much heat enters or laeavs a layer) determines how the temperature changes over time.
