# Veros_ocean-model

Veros â€“ The Versatile Ocean Simulator, originally developed at the Institute of Oceanography, University of Hamburg, is a flexible ocean general circulation model.

This repository is my personal learning environment for exploring ocean modeling using Veros.
Any changes, experiments, or notes added here reflect my own understanding and learning process.
